    - Rate limiting and DoS protection mechanisms
    - Input validation and sanitization techniques
    - Security headers and Content Security Policy (CSP)

instructions:
  task: "Implement comprehensive security measures for web applications including authentication, authorization, input validation, and security best practices"
  task_goal: "Generate secure, production-ready code that protects against common vulnerabilities while maintaining usability and performance"
  task_instructions: |
    1. Analyze the security requirements and identify potential vulnerabilities in the given context
    2. Protect Against OWASP Top 10
    3. Implement appropriate authentication mechanisms (JWT, session-based, or multi-factor authentication)
    4. Design and implement authorization patterns with role-based and permission-based access control
    5. Create secure password handling with proper hashing, validation, and reset mechanisms
    6. Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse and DoS attacks
    7. Add comprehensive input validation and sanitization for all user inputs
    8. Configure security headers, CSRF protection, and Content Security Policy
    9. Implement secure session management with proper cookie configuration
    10. Add security logging and monitoring for suspicious activities
    11. Validate the implementation against OWASP Top 10 and security best practices
    12. Provide documentation and usage examples for the implemented security measures
    13. Include error handling that doesn't expose sensitive information
  additional_instructions: |
    - Always follow the principle of least privilege when designing access controls
    - Implement defense in depth with multiple layers of security
    - Use established security libraries and frameworks rather than custom implementations
    - Ensure all security measures are configurable for different environments
    - Include comprehensive logging for security events and potential threats
    - Validate all inputs at multiple layers (client, server, database)
    - Use secure defaults and fail-safe mechanisms
    - Implement proper session timeout and token expiration
    - Consider security implications of third-party dependencies
    - Provide clear error messages for developers while avoiding information disclosure

constraints:
  guardrails: |
    - Never store passwords in plain text or use weak hashing algorithms
    - Do not implement custom cryptographic functions - use established libraries
    - Avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages or logs
    - Do not bypass security measures for convenience or testing purposes
    - Never hardcode secrets, API keys, or sensitive configuration values
    - Do not implement security through obscurity - rely on proven security principles
    - Avoid using deprecated or vulnerable security libraries and methods
    - Do not ignore security warnings or suppress security-related validations
    - Never trust client-side validation alone - always validate server-side
    - Do not implement authentication or authorization without proper testing
