  - description: "React TypeScript Web Application Documentation Standards"
    input: |
      Project: MCP Client - React/TypeScript browser application
      Team: 3-5 developers, mixed experience levels
      Requirements: Technical docs, API docs, user guides, development standards
    output: |
      # Project Documentation Standards
      
      ## Folder Structure
      - `docs/` - All documentation (except README.md)
      - `docs/technical/` - Architecture, API, implementation details
      - `docs/user/` - User guides, tutorials, FAQ
      - `docs/development/` - Standards, guidelines, workflows
      
      ## File Naming
      - Technical: `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `API_REFERENCE.md`
      - User: `USER_GUIDE.md`, `QUICK_START.md`
      - Development: `CODING_STANDARDS.md`, `WORKFLOW.md`
      
      ## Content Standards
      - All files must include purpose, audience, and last updated
      - Code examples must be tested and functional
      - Cross-references use relative paths
      - Consistent header hierarchy (H1 for title, H2 for sections)

      # PROJECT DOCUMENTATION STANDARDS
      
      ## Overview
      This framework establishes consistent documentation practices for software projects,
      ensuring maintainability, accessibility, and team collaboration effectiveness.
      
      ## Folder Structure Governance
      ### Primary Structure
      - `docs/` - All project documentation (except root README.md)
      - `docs/technical/` - Architecture, implementation, API documentation
      - `docs/user/` - End-user guides, tutorials, FAQ
      - `docs/development/` - Team standards, workflows, contribution guides
      
      ### Governance Rules
      - All .md files except README.md must be in docs/ folder
      - Maximum 3 levels of nested folders within docs/
      - Each folder must contain an index file explaining its contents
      
      ## File Naming Conventions
      - Use UPPERCASE for primary documents: `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `API_REFERENCE.md`
      - Use snake_case for supporting documents: `coding_standards.md`
      - Include version in filename for versioned docs: `api_v1.2.md`
      - Use descriptive names: `deployment_guide.md` not `deploy.md`
